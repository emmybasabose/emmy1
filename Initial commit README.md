Forgive my naming. 

This leads to
A Prompting plugin for android studio that picks sugestions from stack overflow.
It is meant to sugguest better and/or shorter code and could even help in debbuging.

In this Commit, I was able to create a basic plugin that adds a menu item to the Tools menu in Intellij IDEA.
My next commit will be focused on Targeting Android Studio.
I am currently using Intellij IDEA Community Edition 2019.3

Any help towards plugin development is highly appreciated.
